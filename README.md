Started as the client side code for progress of redux tutorial from http://teropa.info/blog/2015/09/10/full-stack-redux-tutorial.html

Is now my boilerplate for production ready react/redux applications

Influences from https://github.com/srn/react-webpack-boilerplate and https://github.com/gaearon/redux-devtools
